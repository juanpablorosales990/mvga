# MVGA Liquidity Provider Program

## Earn USD by Providing VES/USDC Liquidity on Solana

---

## The Opportunity

Venezuela's P2P crypto market processes **$20B+ annually**. 4.3M users trade VES for stablecoins daily — mostly on Binance P2P, where spreads run **3.7-8%** and LPs handle everything manually.

MVGA's VES On-Ramp is a **Solana-powered P2P marketplace** where you stake USDC, set your rate, and earn fees automatically when users buy USDC with bolivars via Pago Movil. Escrow protects both sides.

---

## How It Works

```
You stake USDC → Set your VES/USDC rate + fee
                          ↓
Buyer sees your offer → Sends VES via Pago Movil to your bank
                          ↓
You confirm receipt → Escrow releases USDC to buyer
                          ↓
You keep your fee. Repeat.
```

**Your USDC is held in a Solana on-chain escrow program** — not by MVGA. You control your funds at all times.

## The Economics

| Metric                          | Value                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Typical LP fee                  | 1.5-3% per transaction                              |
| Avg transaction size            | $20-$200 USDC                                       |
| Settlement speed                | Pago Movil: instant. Escrow release: <30 seconds    |
| Operating capital needed        | $500-$5,000 USDC                                    |
| Estimated monthly earnings      | $75-$750 (on $5K capital at 1.5% fee, 10x turnover) |
| Current market spread (Binance) | 3.7-8% — you can undercut and still profit          |

### Example: $2,000 Capital at 2% Fee

| Orders/month   | Monthly earnings | Annualized yield |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 20 ($100 avg)  | $40              | 24% APY          |
| 50 ($100 avg)  | $100             | 60% APY          |
| 100 ($100 avg) | $200             | 120% APY         |

Earnings scale linearly with volume. High-volume LPs on competitive rates get more orders.

## Why MVGA vs. Manual P2P Trading

|                  | Binance P2P                     | MVGA LP                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Escrow           | Centralized (Binance holds)     | On-chain Solana (you hold keys)              |
| Settlement       | Manual chat, screenshot sharing | Automated — confirm receipt, escrow releases |
| Fees to platform | 0% but high friction            | 0% platform fee — your fee is your revenue   |
| Account risk     | Frozen accounts, KYC friction   | Self-custodial wallet, no account freezes    |
| Hours            | 24/7 manual availability        | Set offer → orders come to you               |
| Reputation       | Platform-dependent              | On-chain history, portable                   |

## Who We're Looking For

### Seed LPs (First 5-10)

- **Binance P2P merchants** already trading VES/USDT — you know the market, rates, and risks
- **AirTM cashiers** with existing VES liquidity operations
- **Freelancer communities** holding USDC and wanting yield without DeFi complexity
- **VE diaspora** with USD savings wanting productive deployment in a market they understand

### Requirements

- $500+ USDC to start (no maximum)
- Venezuelan bank account with Pago Movil active (Banesco, Mercantil, Provincial, BNC preferred — highest limits)
- Cedula de identidad
- Smartphone with MVGA app

---

## Your Pago Movil Details

When you create an offer, buyers see your:

- Bank name + code (e.g., Banesco 0134)
- Pago Movil phone number
- Cedula number
- VES amount to send

**You set everything.** Change your rate anytime. Pause offers when you're busy. Withdraw your USDC whenever you want.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Download MVGA** at app.mvga.io
2. **Create wallet** (self-custodial — you own the keys)
3. **Fund with USDC** (deposit via card, bank, or transfer from another wallet)
4. **Go to "Deposit Bolivars" → "Provide Liquidity"**
5. **Set your rate, fee, and Pago Movil details**
6. **Start earning**

---

## Seed LP Benefits

First 10 LPs who join and maintain $1,000+ in offers get:

- **Featured placement** — top of the offer list for 90 days
- **Direct WhatsApp support line** with MVGA team
- **Input on product roadmap** — your feedback shapes the LP experience
- **MVGA token airdrop** — early LP allocation (amount TBD based on volume)

---

## Security

- **On-chain escrow**: USDC locked in audited Solana program, not MVGA's wallet
- **Time-bound orders**: If buyer doesn't send VES in 30 min, escrow auto-refunds to you
- **Dispute resolution**: If there's a conflict, MVGA admin reviews and resolves
- **Self-custodial**: Your keys, your crypto. MVGA never has access to your funds

## FAQ

**Q: What if the buyer claims they sent VES but didn't?**
A: Don't confirm until you see VES in your bank. If you don't confirm and order expires, USDC returns to you. If buyer disputes, MVGA admin reviews Pago Movil evidence.

**Q: Can I set any rate I want?**
A: Yes. But competitive rates get more orders. Check @DolarToday and Binance P2P for market reference.

**Q: What are the Pago Movil limits?**
A: Banesco/Mercantil: Bs 100,000/day (~$260 at parallel rate). For larger operations, use multiple banks or coordinate with MVGA for higher-volume LP solutions.

**Q: Do I need KYC?**
A: No KYC required for LP operations. Your Pago Movil details are visible to buyers (this is standard for P2P in VE).

**Q: What tokens can I stake?**
A: USDC only (Solana SPL). We may add USDT in the future.

**Q: Is there a minimum order size?**
A: You set your own min/max per order (e.g., $10 min, $500 max).
