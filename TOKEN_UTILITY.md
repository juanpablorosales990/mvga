# MVGA Token Utility Model

> **Positioning**: MVGA is a fintech rewards token — not a meme coin, not a security. Think airline miles backed by real platform revenue.

## Core Thesis

The MVGA token is the **loyalty and governance layer** of a digital dollar neobank. Every utility is tied to real platform activity — not speculation. Users earn benefits by participating in the ecosystem, not by buying hype.

## 7 Utility Mechanisms (All Production-Ready)

### 1. Tiered Membership (Stake to Unlock Benefits)

| Tier    | Min Stake | APY Multiplier | Cashback | Fee Discount     | Perks                           |
| ------- | --------- | -------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Bronze  | 0         | 1.0x           | 0%       | 0%               | Basic wallet                    |
| Silver  | 10,000    | 1.2x           | 0.5%     | 10%              | Priority support                |
| Gold    | 50,000    | 1.5x           | 1.0%     | 25%              | Governance voting, early access |
| Diamond | 200,000   | 2.0x           | 2.0%     | 100% (zero fees) | VIP support, exclusive events   |

**Why it's not a meme coin**: Benefits are functional — fee discounts, cashback, support tiers. Like a bank's loyalty program, not a Ponzi.

### 2. Staking with Dynamic APY

- **Base APY**: 12%
- **Lock period multipliers**: 30d (1.25x), 90d (1.5x), 180d (2.0x)
- **Dynamic adjustment**: APY increases when fewer people stake (1.3x when <10% staked), decreases at saturation (0.7x when >50% staked)
- **Auto-compound**: Every 6 hours, minimum 100 MVGA
- **Effective APY range**: 8.4% (Bronze, no lock, saturated) → 62.4% (Diamond, 180d lock, early phase)

### 3. Revenue Sharing

Every week, platform fees from swaps, top-ups, gift cards, and yield are collected and distributed:

- **5% burned** (deflationary)
- **40% → Staking vault** (50% of this = fee sharing to stakers)
- **40% → Liquidity** (ecosystem growth)
- **20% → Grants** (community-funded development)

Rewards come from actual platform activity, not inflationary token emissions. Stakers earn a pro-rata share of 20% of all platform fees weekly.

### 4. Deflationary Burn

- **5% of all platform fees burned every Monday**
- Supply: 1 billion MVGA, permanently decreasing
- Burns tracked on-chain with verifiable signatures
- At scale (e.g., $1M weekly volume with 0.1% fees = $1,000 in fees = $50 burned weekly)

### 5. Governance

- **Stake-weighted voting** on community grants (1 MVGA staked = 1 vote)
- **10% quorum** of total staked supply required
- **Proposals require active stake** to create
- **Hourly auto-tally** with automatic approval/rejection
- Fund allocation for ecosystem development, marketing, partnerships

### 6. Referral Program

- **100 MVGA** to both referrer and referee on signup
- **5% of staking rewards** go to referrer on every claim
- Creates organic growth loop: refer → earn → stake → earn more → refer more

### 7. Fee Discounts & Cashback

- Platform swap fee: **0.1%** (10 basis points)
- Higher tiers pay less:
  - Silver: 0.09% fee + 0.5% cashback
  - Gold: 0.075% fee + 1.0% cashback
  - Diamond: 0% fee + 2.0% cashback
- Diamond users literally **make money** on every swap

## Why This Isn't a Meme Coin

| Meme Coin                   | MVGA                                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| No utility beyond trading   | 7 functional utilities                          |
| Value from hype/speculation | Value from platform revenue                     |
| No revenue model            | 0.1% swap fees, top-up margins, card fees       |
| Inflationary emissions      | 5% weekly fee burn (deflationary)               |

## Revenue-Backed Token Model

```
User Activity → Platform Fees → Weekly Treasury Distribution
                                    ├── 5% Burned (deflationary)
                                    ├── 40% to Stakers (fee sharing)
                                    ├── 40% to Liquidity (growth)
                                    └── 20% to Grants (community)
```

The token captures value proportional to platform usage. More users → more fees → more burns + more rewards → higher demand.

## Next Steps

1. **Escrow mainnet deploy** (~3-5 SOL) — enables P2P with on-chain settlement
2. **Create Raydium MVGA/USDC pool** — DEX liquidity for price discovery
3. **Launch staking program** — activate tier system on mainnet
4. **Enable weekly treasury distribution** — fee sharing from day one
5. **Community grants round 1** — governance legitimacy
