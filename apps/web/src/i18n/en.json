      {
        "q": "Is MVGA safe?",
        "a": "Yes. Unlike custodial wallets where the company holds your money, MVGA is self-custody — your private keys stay on your device and MVGA never holds your funds. P2P exchanges use smart contract escrow that automatically releases funds when both parties confirm. The entire platform is open source and has been through 15 security audit rounds."
      },
      {
        "q": "What does it cost?",
        "a": "Zero platform fees on person-to-person transfers. Currency exchanges have a 0.1% fee. The Visa debit card has no monthly fee and no foreign exchange fee. Network transaction fees are near-zero (less than $0.01)."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do I need a bank account?",
        "a": "No. You can receive money from other MVGA users, deposit via credit/debit card, or exchange with peers using Zelle, PayPal, Venmo, or Pago Móvil. You only need a bank account if you want to cash out to one."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I add money?",
        "a": "Three ways: (1) Receive a transfer from another MVGA user for free. (2) Deposit with a credit card, debit card, or bank transfer via our payment partners. (3) Exchange bolívares for dollars peer-to-peer through the built-in P2P marketplace."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I use it outside Venezuela?",
        "a": "Yes. The wallet works globally. The Visa debit card works at 80M+ merchants worldwide. Phone top-ups work for Venezuelan carriers from anywhere. The app is used by the Venezuelan diaspora in the US, Spain, Colombia, and beyond."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is there a mobile app?",
        "a": "Yes! MVGA is available on the App Store for iPhone. You can also visit app.mvga.io in your browser to use it as a Progressive Web App on any device. Both versions include push notifications, offline support, and biometric unlock."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does the rewards program work?",
        "a": "You earn rewards for using the platform and referring friends. Higher reward tiers unlock fee discounts (up to 100% off), cashback, and priority support. Rewards come from real platform revenue, not inflation."
      },
      {
        "q": "How is MVGA different from Meru, Zinli, or Wally?",
        "a": "Those wallets are custodial — they hold your money in their accounts. If they shut down, your funds are at risk. They also charge monthly fees (up to $0.99/mo), VES withdrawal fees (up to 4%), and impose low monthly limits ($1,500-$3,000). MVGA is self-custody (you hold your own keys), has zero platform fees, no monthly charges, no arbitrary limits, and offers DeFi yields, phone top-ups, and on-chain P2P escrow — features none of them have."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is MVGA open source?",
        "a": "Yes. The entire platform — API, wallet app, and this website — is public on GitHub. Anyone can audit the code and verify exactly what the platform does. 15 security audits completed with zero known vulnerabilities. No other dollar wallet targeting Venezuela is open source."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is USDC?",
        "a": "USDC is a digital US dollar created by Circle and backed 1:1 by US dollar reserves held at regulated financial institutions. Every USDC is worth exactly $1. It runs on the Solana blockchain, which means transfers settle in under 1 second and cost less than $0.01. Unlike crypto that goes up and down, USDC is a stablecoin — your $100 stays $100."
      },
      {
        "q": "What if I lose my phone?",
        "a": "When you create your wallet, you get a 12-word recovery phrase. Write it down and keep it safe. If you lose your phone, install the app on a new device and enter your recovery phrase to restore your wallet and all your funds. No one else can access your money without this phrase — not even MVGA."
      },
      {
        "q": "How is MVGA funded?",
        "a": "MVGA earns revenue from small fees on currency swaps (0.1-0.3%) and partner commissions on services like phone top-ups and gift cards. Person-to-person transfers are always free. There are no hidden fees, no monthly charges, and no investor pressure to monetize users. Revenue is transparently distributed: 40% to liquidity, 40% to staking rewards, and 20% to community grants."
