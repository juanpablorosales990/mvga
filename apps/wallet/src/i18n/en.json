    "faq2a": "Share your wallet address or QR code with the sender. They can send SOL, USDC, USDT, or MVGA tokens directly. Funds arrive in seconds with minimal fees on Solana.",
    "faq3q": "How does staking work?",
    "faq3a": "Stake your MVGA tokens to earn rewards. Choose a lock period for higher APY — 30-day, 90-day, or 180-day locks earn 1.5x, 2x, or 3x rewards respectively. Flexible staking has no lock.",
    "faq4q": "How do I use P2P trading?",
    "faq4a": "Go to P2P Exchange to buy or sell crypto with Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, or bank transfer. Trades use an escrow system — crypto is locked until both parties confirm the fiat payment.",
    "faq5q": "How do I create a grant proposal?",
    "faq5a": "Navigate to Grants and tap 'Propose'. You need staked MVGA to create a proposal. Describe your Venezuelan business, set a funding amount, and the community votes with their staked tokens.",
    "faq6q": "What are the fees?",
