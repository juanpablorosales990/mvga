## 1. MANIFESTO

### Make Venezuela Great Again: A Declaration of Economic Freedom

**We believe** that every Venezuelan deserves access to stable money, regardless of where they live or what their government does.

**We believe** that 7 million Venezuelans scattered across the world should be able to support their families back home without losing 15% to remittance fees.

**We believe** that the entrepreneurial spirit of Venezuelans - the same spirit that built thriving businesses before Chavismo, the same spirit that drives Venezuelan doctors, engineers, and workers to excel in every country they reach - deserves the chance to rebuild their homeland.

**We believe** that cryptocurrency, properly designed and honestly run, can be a tool of liberation for people trapped by economic tyranny.

**We believe** that memes have power - the power to build community, to spread ideas, to make people care about causes they'd otherwise ignore.

**We are MVGA** - Make Venezuela Great Again.

We are not just a token. We are a movement.

We are building:
- **A wallet** that lets Venezuelans hold stable value when their currency fails them
- **A bridge** that connects the diaspora to their families at minimal cost
- **A fund** that deploys real resources to help Venezuelans in need
- **An ecosystem** that supports Venezuelan entrepreneurs building the future

We know the road is long. We know trust must be earned. We know that Venezuela's problems won't be solved by a token.

But we also know that every journey begins with a single step.

**Join us.** Not just as an investor hoping for gains - but as a member of a community committed to genuine impact.

**Patria y vida. Venezuela será libre.**

### Our Values

- **TRANSPARENCY** - Every wallet public. Every transaction explainable. Every fund deployment documented.
- **IMPACT OVER HYPE** - We use meme energy to capture attention, but we measure success by lives improved.
- **COMMUNITY FIRST** - Token holders are members who vote on key decisions and hold us accountable.
- **LONG-TERM THINKING** - Liquidity locked. Team tokens vest slowly. We're here for the mission.
- **VENEZUELAN PRIDE** - By Venezuelans, for Venezuelans, celebrating Venezuelan culture and resilience.
